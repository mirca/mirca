Hi there!

I'm PhD student at HKUST working with [@dppalomar](https://github.com/dppalomar) on interesting problems
involving financial time-series analysis. I was previously a scientific software engineer intern at
[NASA](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/news/1529/meet-the-kepler-mission-team/) and
[NIST](https://www.nist.gov).

I spend most of my time doing [research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=ilvNpCoAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and coding
that thing [@dppalomar](https://github.com/dppalomar) asked about.
