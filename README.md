### Hi there!

I graduated with a PhD from the Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering at HKUST, in sunny Hong Kong,
where I was a member of the [Convex Optimization in Finance Group](https://github.com/convexfi).

My PhD research focused on problems involving [graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)) and financial
time series, where I designed [optimization algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization) combined with elements of
[graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory) and
[statistical learning theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_learning_theory),
to extract knowledge from networks of financial assets.
Our research results during my PhD were published in venues such as
NeurIPS, ICML, JMLR, AISTATS, and AAAI. I also served as a reviewer for NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, JMLR, and IEEE TNNLS.

I have done a number of internships along the way:

* equity quant at [Merrill Lynch](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bank-of-america-merrill-lynch/): wrote code for portfolio risk optimization and limit order book forecasting;
* research scientist at [Shell Street Labs](https://www.linkedin.com/company/shell-street-labs/about/): wrote code for portfolio strategy optimization;
* scientific software engineer at [National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/news/1529/meet-the-kepler-mission-team/): part of the lead developers team of [lightkurve](https://github.com/lightkurve/lightkurve), an open source package for time series analysis of NASA [Kepler, K2](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/main/index.html), & [TESS](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/tess/) data;
* Google Summer of Code developer for [OpenAstronomy](https://www.openastronomy.org): improved the point spread function photometry capabilities of [photutils](https://github.com/astropy/photutils/graphs/contributors);
* guest researcher at [National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)](https://www.nist.gov): research on nanophotonics published in [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00987-6) and [Review of Scientific Instruments](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/1.4976578);

### Publications

Here's a list of selected papers that I published together with my co-authors during my PhD:

* [Learning Bipartite Graphs: Heavy Tails and Multiple Components](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=WNSyF9qZaMd), NeurIPS 2022
* [Graphical Models in Heavy-Tailed Markets](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2021/hash/a64a034c3cb8eac64eb46ea474902797-Abstract.html), NeurIPS 2021
* [Nonconvex Sparse Graph Learning under Laplacian Constrained Graphical Model](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/hash/4ef42b32bccc9485b10b8183507e5d82-Abstract.html), NeurIPS 2020
* [Structured Graph Learning Via Laplacian Spectral Constraints](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/9339-structured-graph-learning-via-laplacian-spectral-constraints), NeurIPS 2019

### Projects

Projects that I've worked on most recently:

* [riskparity.py:](https://github.com/convexfi/riskparity.py)
performant code for constructing optimal risk parity portfolios in
Python
* [fingraph:](https://github.com/convexfi/fingraph) estimating networks of financial assets
in R
* [bipartite:](https://github.com/convexfi/bipartite) estimating bipartite graphs
with applications to asset classification in R

I spend most of my time doing [research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=ilvNpCoAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate)
and [coding](https://github.com/mirca). Outside of that, I love swimming and
crab hunting in the waters of Clear Water Bay and video-chatting with my nephew
Chico and my dog Pluto.
