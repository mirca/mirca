### Hi there!

I'm Zé Vinícius, a PhD candidate at HKUST, in sunny Hong Kong, working with [Prof. Daniel Palomar](https://github.com/dppalomar)
on interesting problems involving [graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)) and financial time series.
I design [optimization algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization) using elements of [graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory) and [statistical learning theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_learning_theory)
to extract knowledge from networks of financial assets.

I have done a few internships along the way:

* equity quant at [Merrill Lynch](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bank-of-america-merrill-lynch/): wrote code for portfolio risk optimization and limit order book forecasting;
* research scientist at [Shell Street Labs](https://www.linkedin.com/company/shell-street-labs/about/): wrote code for portfolio strategy optimization;
* scientific software engineer at [NASA](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/news/1529/meet-the-kepler-mission-team/): helped built [lightkurve](https://github.com/lightkurve/lightkurve);
* Google Summer of Code developer for [OpenAstronomy](https://www.openastronomy.org): improved the point spread function photometry capabilities of [photutils](https://github.com/astropy/photutils/graphs/contributors);
* guest researcher at [NIST](https://www/nist.gov): research on nanophotonics published in [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00987-6);

### Publications

Here's a list of selected papers that I published together with my co-authors during my PhD:

* [Learning Bipartite Graphs: Heavy Tails and Multiple Components](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=WNSyF9qZaMd), NeurIPS 2022
* [Graphical Models in Heavy-Tailed Markets](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2021/hash/a64a034c3cb8eac64eb46ea474902797-Abstract.html), NeurIPS 2021
* [Nonconvex Sparse Graph Learning under Laplacian Constrained Graphical Model](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/hash/4ef42b32bccc9485b10b8183507e5d82-Abstract.html), NeurIPS 2020
* [Structured Graph Learning Via Laplacian Spectral Constraints](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/9339-structured-graph-learning-via-laplacian-spectral-constraints), NeurIPS 2019

### Projects

Projects that I've worked on most recently:

* [riskparity.py:](https://github.com/convexfi/riskparity.py)
performant code for constructing optimal risk parity portfolios in
Python
* [fingraph:](https://github.com/convexfi/fingraph) estimating networks of financial assets
in R
* [bipartite:](https://github.com/convexfi/bipartite) estimating bipartite graphs
with applications to asset classification in R

I spend most of my time doing [research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=ilvNpCoAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate)
and [coding](https://github.com/mirca). Outside of that, I love swimming and
crab hunting in the waters of Clear Water Bay and video-chatting with my nephew
Chico and my dog Pluto.
