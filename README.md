### Hi, I’m Zé Vinícius

I'm a PhD candidate at HKUST, in sunny Hong Kong, working with [Prof. Daniel Palomar](https://github.com/dppalomar)
on interesting problems involving [graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)) and financial time series.
More precisely, I design [optimization algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization) using elements of [graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory) and [statistical learning theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_learning_theory)
to extract knowledge from networks of financial assets. Previously, I interned as a scientific software engineer
at [NASA](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/news/1529/meet-the-kepler-mission-team/) in Silicon Valley, California, 
and [NIST](https://www.nist.gov) in Gaithersburg, Maryland. I was a Google Summer of Code developer for [OpenAstronomy](https://www.openastronomy.org).

I spend most of my time doing [research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=ilvNpCoAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate)
and [coding](https://github.com/mirca). In my free time, there is nothing better than swimming and crab hunting in the waters
of Clear Water Bay and video-chatting with my dog, Pluto.
